$ git clone https://github.com/stanislavkrsv/myreads.git
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Building the Project

```shell
$ npm run build
```

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
